This repository is the codebase for Jake Kadir's dissertation project.

The repository includes three primary directories:
- `recipe_rec` - a Python package that implements four recommender systems to deliver recommendations for a dataset
- `data` - includes the primary data source, `recipes.csv` and holds intermediate binary files used by the recommender systems
- `exploration` - includes Jupyter Notebooks used to perform EDA on the dataset
